# dev-friday-browserify

This is a small example/seed project for the codecentric dev friday about
Browserify and CommonJS, happening on 2015-04-10 in Solingen.

It is basically a copy of the [jQuery TodoMvc app](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/jquery), converted to a proper CommonJS based application.
